<h1>Products Management System (PMS)</h1>
This is a simple Products Management System (PMS) built using JavaScript. The system allows you to manage various products, including their descriptions and pricing information. The system does not rely on a back-end or database, and instead uses local storage to store data about the products.

<h3 id="section-3">Security</h3>
While the PMS does not rely on a back-end or database, it does use local storage to store data about the products. This data is stored in the user's browser, and is only accessible to the user who is currently using the system. However, keep in mind that local storage is not a secure way to store sensitive data, and it is not recommended to use this system for managing highly sensitive or confidential information.
